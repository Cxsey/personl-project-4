<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> “Clash Royale” is a real-time strategy mobile video game that was developed by Supercell in 2016. Put simply, you choose 8 cards from the collection of 103 different troop, spell and building cards, to help you defend your tower against your enemy. There are many different game modes, but the two most basic ones are 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2.  <p>


<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">The goal of the game is to take out more of the other person's towers in the three minutes or so you have to play. Because the game is packed with so many different minions to choose from, each match can feel very different. Players can only include eight of their minion types in a deck, so finding the right balance for your style of play is important.

 <p>



<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"> The real-time, player-versus-player game has players building a deck of sorts and then dropping into a form of tower defense. Each side has to use slowly refilling elixir to spawn minions who both defend your buildings and attack your enemies. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Every so often, a game comes into my life that makes me feel strange. I think this feeling might be ... love. Total War: Three Kingdoms is one of those games. It manages to make me feel like a new man, specifically, a powerful Chinese warlord circa 200 AD. <p>

  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Before it came out, I thought I might admire Three Kingdoms, but drooling adoration is not the reaction I had anticipated. This game is the latest in a long line of interesting, flawed, occasionally dull historical simulations of superpower administration and warfare. While other Total War games have focused on the Romans or the Shogunate or Napoleon, Three Kingdoms takes us to China, at the end of the Han dynasty. An empire is fracturing. Its constituent parts are in a state of chaotic intra-fighting.<br><br>Like its predecessors, Three Kingdoms puts me in charge of a fiefdom, from which my grand aspirations take shape. I plot expansion and march my armies into neighboring domains. We engage in battle. If I win, my empire grows and my rival’s diminishes. I use my new possessions as taxation pools, which fund more armies. I take care to maintain a well-fed and well-behaved populace. I build buildings and I learn learnings, all of which yield me more money, more food, and better soldiers.<br><br>These are the basics of all Total War games. Their main attraction is an ever-improving and always impressive war engine, in which I manage a battle in real time, pointing my squadrons of horse, range, artillery, and infantry in the right direction, while hoping that my tactics are better than the enemy’s.

  <h1><p style="text-align:left;">No.1 Age of empires IV </p></h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> “Age of Empires IV” has the same thin veneer of edutainment as a show about the famous battles of history, but extended through a real-time strategy game. Players can take the role of one of eight historical empires, like the Holy Roman Empire or the Mongols, and enter into battles where they control every part of that group’s resource production and warfare. Create workers, build farms, deforest areas, and turn those supplies into the infantry, cavalry, and siege engines that destroy all of the enemies in your wake; this is the imperial way. These games play out in campaign missions with specific objectives (take some towns; hold defenses for a certain amount of time) or more free-form multiplayer maps with a mix of warfare and building win conditions.
<a>


  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Each empire has a unique set of game mechanics. The English have their longbows, the Rus have warrior-priests on horseback, and the Mongols can move their production buildings after being placed, to name a few. These give each empire its own flavor and way of approaching challenges, though at the core they all operate in similar ways. You gather, you build, you deploy, and then you fight.<br><br>Getting better at “Age of Empires IV” means learning how those two things — the base building and the troop management — operate as interlocked systems. You learn through trial and error how to best command your troops and when you can take your eyes off them for a few seconds to order your blacksmith to make better swords or to make a new lumber facility. In the heat of battle, you begin to understand how to stutter-step your archers forward so they can hit the back row of enemy bowmen. The whole system begins to swing in tandem, but that swinging is based on inertia, and it takes a lot of time investment to get there.<br><br>
If learning these ins and outs, and wielding them against other players in competitive modes, is what you come to games for, then “Age of Empires IV” probably has enough to keep you satisfied. Even playing a fairly limited number of multiplayer matches during the review period allowed me to get a sense of the “StarCraft II”-esque balance between the different empires. While I would never claim to be a pro player, my mid-level experience allowed me to get through all of the game campaigns on the intermediate difficulty without too many moments of frustration or anger.
